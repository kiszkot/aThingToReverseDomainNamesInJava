# aThingToReverseDomainNames

This was a task for Programming II were we had to write a program to reverse domain names. It is common in Java projects to use reverse domain names to name packages. cs.princeton.edu, the domain of the creators of algs4 is not the name of he package. The package is under edu.princeton.cs.algs4. This program just reverses domain names.
